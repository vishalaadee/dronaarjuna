# dronaarjuna
Dronarjuna is a website which can minimize the reachability gap between students and professors .
This website aims at bringing great young minds closer to experienced and professional professors to collaborate together and work on exciting projects.
I felt a need of making such platform because I had observed my peers shying away from asking professors to collaborate on some project . 
Here, professors can themselves reach out to students who have uploaded their work in some domain and shown interest in the domain in which 
the professor might also be interested in . So whether you call it a Drona-Arjuna Matching website or simply Dronarjuna but the outcome is going to be fruitful. 
This WebSite can also be used as a college project evaluation website where students can upload their major/minor projects and professors can evaluate the same.

Version 2 Goal : Make it more secure â€‹. Make it available for more colleges and universities.
